        <p> My name is Corbin Provost. I am a senior Marketing major at the University of Rhode Island. I am 21 years old. I am currently living in Rhode Island permanently now, but was born and raised in New Hampshire. It was a small town named Bow near Concord.  In my free time I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends and messing around with photoshop. Recently I have been designing emotes for users on Twitch which is a website where people watch their favorite gamers. I have been really enjoying that work and hope to turn it into a job of some sorts some day. </p>
