      <h1>My Final Project</h1>
        <p id= "welcome"> This is my final project. It is a game designed for younger kids as I was with my niece when I thought of it. It is an avatar of me and the goal of the game is to help me finish my homework. My homework consists of five multiple choice questions. Don't worry though as a young child plays this you might not be able to get one and that is why I included a page to skip to any question you would like. If you get a question wrong you can try that question again or skip to the next one. At the end of the game you can either play again or end the game. I hope you enjoy my game!</p>
